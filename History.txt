h2. 2.0.0
HYDRA-827 DO NOT index terms by default
HYDRA-863 Null pointer exception fixed.

BUG: Replaced data_type method with type which was causing the :type option in OM terms not to work.  This makes certain tests
     not pass under Ruby 1.8.7, specifically when using :type option with a proxied term in OM.

BUG: Fixed TerminologyBasedSolrizer#solrize_node instance method to call class method correctly, and changed #solrize_term to call instance method #solrize_node so that it can be overridden by subclasses

Test fixes such as properly testing solr field suffixes when using the :type option in OM as well as using correct
ISO.8601 dates in our fixtures

h2. 1.0.3

BUG: Extractor.format_field_values was choking when value was nil

h2. 1.0.0

Deprecated

* extract_tag
* extract_tags
* extract_hash


All solrize and extract methods now accept and return a _Hash_ rather than a Solr::Document
Removed dependency on outdated "solr" gem, replaced it with RSolr
As part of this switch, *all field names are stored as Strings, not Symbols*. If you previously accessed something as solr_doc[:title_t], now you need to access it as solr_doc["title_t"] 

Moved #format_node_value and #insert_solr_field_value from TerminologyBasedSolrizer to Solrizer::Extractor

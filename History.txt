h2. 1.0.0

Deprecated

* extract_tag
* extract_tags
* extract_hash


All solrize and extract methods now accept and return a _Hash_ rather than a Solr::Document
Removed dependency on outdated "solr" gem, replaced it with RSolr
As part of this switch, *all field names are stored as Strings, not Symbols*. If you previously accessed something as solr_doc[:title_t], now you need to access it as solr_doc["title_t"] 

Moved #format_node_value and #insert_solr_field_value from TerminologyBasedSolrizer to Solrizer::Extractor
